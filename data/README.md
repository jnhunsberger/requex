# NOTICE

All collected data from our various datasources has been moved to Google Cloud Storage. The cloud bucket is available here:

- `https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/requex_archives_raw`
- `gs://requex_archives_raw`

There are scripts in the ../code repo that will download and prepare the files for archiving.

This data folder will remain in the repo for historical or local use, but is not expected to contain anything important for requex data processing.
