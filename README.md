# REQUEX.NET Code Repository

__Summary__: A DNS Firewall service that moves beyond the blacklist to identify previously undiscovered threats.

## Team Cyber

## Description
Malware and hacking is an issue that affects all of society. In 2016 alone, cyber attacks cost the US economy over $100B. These attacks not only affect the economy, but the general public as well.

Once a computer is infected, the malware establishes communication with command and control servers which allows malware to download new attack instructions or to monetize their botnet by selling access to the network of infected computers.

Today, malware uses the Domain Name System (or DNS) to hide its command and control servers. It does this by using domain generating algorithms (or DGAs) to flood DNS with requests for thousands of spurious domain names.

Traditionally, security teams use blacklists to block these communications. Unfortunately, blacklists are not effective against domain generating algorithms: there are thousands of domains being generated every day. Defenders cannot keep up with the deluge.

To solve the problems presented by malware that uses domain generation algorithms, our team is building Requeâœ˜ DNS - an intelligent DNS firewall with an integrated deep-learning model that can block requests to algorithm-generated domains. This blockage prevents the malware from communicating with its command and control servers.
